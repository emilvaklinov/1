      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am proactive person looking for new challenges and shared satisfaction.
        My deverse background and detailed experince can be seen in
         <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-vaklinov/"target="_blank"> Linkedin</a>.</p>

      <h3>Why am I appling to Founders & Coders?</h3>
      <p>I am really focused on learning how to code now and I think that Founders and Coders is a great place where I can improve my coding knowledge and create more projects.
        The experience which I will get during the training will give me a good start in my career and eventually I will be able to create a start up of my own.
        I did my first steps in coding last year which was a great start. I want to learn JavaScript in depth in order to be able to create more complex projects with confidence.
        I believe that my previous experience, creativity and ideas will make me a suitable candidate.</p>

      <p>I also want to share some of my profesional non-coding work projects which shows my experience in different industries
        but connected to many tech solutions like the touristic industry
        <a href="http://kashta-bilyanska.wixsite.com/kashta-bilyanska"target="_blank"> Hospitality</a>,
        festivals and on-line photo and short film contests creation and management <a href="https://www.rhodopecontest.org"target="_blank"> Festivals & contests</a>,
        Aslo leading companies for investments, consultancies and innovative solutions <a href="http://www.richdevelopment.net/index.php"target="_blank"> RICH Development</a>.</p>


      <h3>Skills and experience</h3>
      <p>I have already passed my first boot camp in 2018 where I  studied Ruby,
        Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, basic PostgreSQL, Hybernate, Git, Node.js,
        UX Design and much more. However, my attempts to find a job were
        unsuccsessful because I was told multiple times that I lack commercial experience.
I believe FAC can help me refresh my skills and knowledge and be able to, this time, successfuly find a job as a Full-Stack Developer.
  I have fulfilled the prerequisites, which can be seen here: <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/emilvaklinov"target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a>,
  <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/trakieca"target="_blank">Code Academy</a> and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/trakieca"target="_blank">Code Wars </a>.
  The most of my code and work are visible in <a href="https://github.com/emilvaklinov/Portfolio"target="_blank">GitHub </a>.
  This platform of projects and gathered experience is my stable fundament for future development.</p>
    <h4>Make the dreams real.!!</h4>
