# This is a Portfolio site with 2 sub pages!

## Main page:

## Portfolio: https://emilvaklinov.github.io/Portfolio/

## Sub pages:
 1. Projects: https://emilvaklinov.github.io/Projects/

 2. Certificates: https://emilvaklinov.github.io/Certificates/

All sub-pages are created together with the main page and are part of one UX design vision! 
```
```
=========== M V P =============
```
```
## Create a one-page website;
```
1. Create a one-page website in HTML and CSS (using some vanilla JavaScript if youâ€™d --like) and host it on GitHub Pages.
```
```
2. Your commit history should tell a story and your website must:
```
```
3. Tell us about who you are and why you are applying for the programme;
```
```
4. Demonstrate your learning from the prerequisites;
```
```
5. Contain a link back to the GitHub repo that contains the code for your site;
```
```
6. Contain links to your freeCodeCamp (please make sure that your profile is public) and Codewars pages;
```
```
7. Include an image carousel;
```
```
8. Be hosted on Github.
```
```
9. Not use a GitHub theme!
```
```
10. Not use any Javascript or CSS libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery or use an image carousel package like Flickity - we want to see your own code!
```
