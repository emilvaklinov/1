This is a Portfolio one page site!

=========== M V P =============

*Create a one-page website
*Create a one-page website in HTML and CSS (using some vanilla JavaScript if youâ€™d --like) and host it on GitHub Pages. Your commit history should tell a story, and your website must:
*Tell us about who you are and why you are applying for the programme
*Demonstrate your learning from the prerequisites
*Contain a link back to the GitHub repo that contains the code for your site
*Contain links to your freeCodeCamp (please make sure that your profile is public) and Codewars pages
*Include an image carousel
*Be hosted on Github
*Not use a GitHub theme
*Not use any Javascript or CSS libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery or use an image carousel package like Flickity - we want to see your own code.
